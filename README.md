- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheResearcherNr4
- 👀 I’m interested in Data and all that it can provide. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenShift, ML, BigData and how to Git good. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might interest me at any moment. If I do, I promise to commit. 
- 📫 How to reach me is via old school smoke signals or a particularly catchy tune. #makecommunicationeasy
